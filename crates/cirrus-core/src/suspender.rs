//! `Suspender` trait — future-producing object the engine watches to
//! decide when a paused plan should resume.
//!
//! Lives in `cirrus-core` (rather than `cirrus-engine`) so plan factories
//! and preprocessors in `cirrus-plans` can reference the trait without
//! pulling the engine in. The engine's `Msg::InstallSuspender` carries
//! an `Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync>` and downcasts it to `Arc<dyn
//! Suspender>` at install time.
